# Hi, I’m Farid 👋

I’m an entrepreneur and full-stack developer based between Belgium and Japan.  
Most of my days are split between **building products**, **helping clients ship**, and **learning by doing**.

I run [**Yaba-IT**](https://yaba-ib.be/) — a small studio where I turn ideas into maintainable web apps.  
I try to keep things simple, clear, and realistic: I’d rather deliver something solid than chase complexity.

---

## What I’m focused on these days

- Shipping and iterating on multiple projects (sometimes messy, always learning).
- Building web apps for real workflows (not just demos).
- Improving backend structure with **Python** (Django / FastAPI).
- Staying “security-aware” in a practical way (auth, permissions, data handling, basics).

---

## How I work

- I like **small steps**, tight feedback loops, and shipping early.
- I’m comfortable owning the full flow: discovery → build → deploy → maintenance.
- When I don’t know, I read, test, ask, and document (then improve next iteration).

---

## Tech I use (and what I’m learning)

**Comfortable with**
- React, Javascript, Node.js, Python
- REST APIs, Postgres, MongoDB, Supabase, Auth0
- Git, CI, Docker

**Learning / building confidence**
- Django & FastAPI patterns
- Better architecture, testing discipline, and ops fundamentals
- Security fundamentals (OWASP mindset, threat-aware defaults)
